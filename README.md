I am taking a long break from software engineering to study for a [maths masters.](https://www.open.ac.uk/postgraduate/qualifications/f04)

I have also, as a result of reprehensible actions of the UK Labour government, had no choice but to return to disability activism as a coordinator for [Disabled People Against Cuts Cymru (DPAC Cymru)](https://dpac-cymru.carrd.co/) and as a [socialist.](https://www.socialistparty.org.uk/)

My thanks to everyone that I've had the pleasure to work with these past ten years.

Kind regards,

Ben Golightly
